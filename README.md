# Js-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my 4rd JS project. It's the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe!

The purpose of this project was to expand my knowledge of JQuery and to start to use OO parts of JS. I failed to do
this(I don't use any Prototype or anything but primitive data), but don't really feel like taking the time to adjust the project.
I will have more experience with this in the future and have already done that OO part in [this](https://github.com/jose56wonton/tic_tac_toe) ruby project.

This project can be found on my website [here](http://joshuawootonn.com/js-tic-tac-toe/)!

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) JS track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/tic-tac-toe?ref=lc-pb)!
